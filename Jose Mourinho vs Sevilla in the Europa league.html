    <h1>Sevilla vs Roma: History broken</h1><br>
    <p>The Europa league final between Sevilla and Roma leaves everyone surprised as Jose mourinho's record of winning every Europa final he plays was broken by Sevilla. </p>
    <p>
        
    the saga got more interesting  as Sevilla's victory features two Moroccan national team members Yassin Bono and  Youssef El-Nesiri who also featured in the Morocco 1-nill victory over Portugal in the 2022 FIFA world cup in Qatar helped Sevilla secure their seventh time Europa league title. Jose mourinho has won every single Europa competition final he has played including the Europa conference league final in his first season with Roma. He coached Roma through to the finals after maintaining a 1-nill aggregate over Bayer Leverkusen in the semi-finals while Sevilla beat Juventus in the semi-finals to make it to the final. </p>
        <p>
          Sevilla defeated Roma even after Roma  seemed to have  a very  good start in the early minutes of the game.<br>
          Alex Telles who also featured in the Sevilla's  squad  against  Roma, helped knock Manchester  United  out in the  quarter finals of the league despite  being loaned to Roma from  Manchester United in season's beginning.

   The story becomes more intriguing knowing that Sevilla is in the bare bottom of the laliga standings for the just concluded laliga season. they didn't qualify for the Champions league in the forth coming  season and barely qaulified for any European  competition in the coming season. <br>
   This is still unbelievable to some people that Sevilla  could lift the Europa league title despite competing with some major European  clubs like Juventus, Manchester  united, Barcelona and whole lot of others. </p>

         Bryan Gill also featured in the sevilla squad  winning  the Europa  league  title  with  Sevilla  for the second time. He was part of the Sevilla's  squad  who won 2019-2020 Europa league title before he signed for Tottenham Hotspur in 2021. Back again  to Sevilla,he won the Europa  league title for the second time.
