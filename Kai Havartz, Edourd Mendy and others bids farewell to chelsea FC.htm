      <h1>Kai Havertz Bids farewell to chelsea and shows off his new club</>
  <p>
The ex chelsea forward, now a Gunner has bidden  his heart felt farewell to his former and beloved club which was now what seemed like a second home to him.     
        
  </p>  
  <p>
  Havartz in an open letter on his social media handle expressed himself to his fans, lovers and entire chelsea board saying that it was never his intentions to leave the club which he loves so much because  he has gone through ups and downs with them starting from winning the champions league in his first season as a blues, then winning the super cup and finally winning the club world cup.
        
  </p>  
  <p>
   "Joining  chelsea  three years ago was a big moment in my life and I am looking back to these days with nothing but pride, greatfulness and lots of sports success". He also added  "I hope everyone remembers me for this, I am looking back to memories that lasts a lifetime, the club will forever be in my heart, it's an honor to be part of  Chelsea's story".
        
  </p>
  <p>
  On another post, he further identified himself as a Gunner, showing off his new kit in style.
