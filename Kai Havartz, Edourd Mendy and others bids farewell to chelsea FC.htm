  Havartz in an open letter on his social media handle expressed himself to his fans, lovers and entire chelsea board saying that it was never his intentions to leave the club which he loves so much because  he has gone through ups and downs with them starting from winning the champions league in his first season as a blues, then winning the super cup and finally winning the club world cup.

He also added  "I hope everyone remembers me for this, I am looking back to memories that lasts a lifetime, the club will forever be in my heart, it's an honor to be part of  Chelsea's story".
