competition to be held in the stadium in question.

    a large capacity of persons, others are designed in such a way that they can handle a very large number of visitors. The capacity of a stadium
    is not just essential for the competition to be held, it is also very important for the owners of the team as it determines the revenue they generate 
    from every competition being held in their stadium and also gives room for a very well equiped and standard training center for the players .

Some club owners invest wildly on stadiums in other to accomodate guests comfortably and also to realize bigger profit in their investments, therefore raising 
the value of their stadium to an enviable height. The values and the capacities of stadiums today depends on the competitions the team is involved in, this is simply
