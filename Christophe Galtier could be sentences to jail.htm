     <h1> Christophe Galtier  could be sentenced to jail </h1>
     <p>Due to racism investigations in OGC Nice where Galtier was their manager, the PSG boss has been summoned for questioning alongside his son John Valovic-Galtier. Though Galtier son has been released without charges imposed on him, Christophe Galtier will face a trial on 15th of December in Nice, France for discrimination and harassment. 
           
           
     </p>
     <p>Sources affirmed Galtier's racial reations on black and Muslim players in the club, claiming that there are so many of them. Due to the FIFA anti racism rules,  he was ceased and placed in the police custody for investigation, This is definitely a threat to his career as he will be sent to three years imprisonment if found guilty of the allegations leveled against him by Xavier Bonhome, he will also be made to pay a fine of &euro;45,000. Galtier denied these accusations, claiming that he didn't make any racial comments against blacks and Muslim players. 
     <p>Galtier  is still the head coach of PSG even though his performances in the just concluded season wasn't acceptable  enough to the club president who is already making attempts to replace him having one more year in contract and coaching the club to a league one title.
