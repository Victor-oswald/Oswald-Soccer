  <h1>Why Wolves chose Al Hilal over Barcelona for Ruben Neves</h1>
  <p>
    Wolverhampton has agreed on a transfer deal of &euro;47 million for Ruben Neves, The deal has been signed 
    and will expire on June,2026.</p>
  <p>
    The 26 years old Portuguese has been in the transfer  list of many European clubs including  Barcelona, but has 
    all been dismissed as the club confirms his departure  to the Saudi  Arabian league for Al Hilal. Despite having one 
    more year in contract with  Wolverhampton and also been the teams captain, Neves  accepted  the  Arabian deal to join 
    other top notch players in the Saudi Arabian journey. He will play alongside Karim Benzema and Åƒgolo Kante whose deal is 
    yet to be announced. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Ruben Neves  has made a total of 253 career appearances for wolverhampton in all competitions with a success, this is the 
    reason Wolverhampton considers him a very important market option to raise just enough funds and support the club.
