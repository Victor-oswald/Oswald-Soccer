      <h1>This is why Mason Mount rejected  a new contract at chelsea</h1>
 <img src="Mount .webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Mason Mount"/>
      <p>It often happens in football that a player might all of a sudden  not want to renew his  contract with the current  club, this could be due to an undisclosed  reason but sometimes it is not far from personal terms. The former Chelsea Midfielder "Mount" who recently joined Manchester United on a transfer deal worth &euro;60 million, refused to sign new deal with Chelsea football club stating clearly to the board "sell me now or loose me on a free transfer next season".
 </p>
 <p>Though Mount didn't openly speak on why he doesn't want to continue his career with the blues despite being raised in the Chelsea academy, we have come to realize that he wants to try a different career phase since he has been playing with the club from the onset. Looking at the Chelsea situation, Mount lost most of his team mates and friends due to Chelsea's massive player clearance this season. He might be considering his career at the club with the new intakes and a whole new management and coaching staffs, reports didn't include salary reasons, conflicts or misunderstanding, it's clearly personal decisions which he chose not to disclose in mean time.
