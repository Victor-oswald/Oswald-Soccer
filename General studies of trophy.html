<h1>The History And Evolution of Trophy</h1><br>
<h3>Introduction:</h3><br>
<p style="font-size: large;">
    Every internationally recognized sport has a reward(trophies), hence different trophies has earned global recognition as sports keep on
    emerging by the day. Most of these trophies are issued by international communities or individuals sometimes in honour of the sports person 
    or the sports team as the case may be.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Trophy is very significant to every sport as it triggers the spirit of competition amongst the competitors and also encourage the sports lovers 
        and parents to enroll thier children in sporting academies and training centers so as to keep on the continuity of various sports competitions 
        present today and many more still to emerge with time.
    </p><br>
    <h3>WHAT IS A TROPHY</h3>
    <img src="trophy.jpeg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="A Trophy"/>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        A trophy can be seen as anything gained from a contest or from a war (the reward for victory) usually reserved for memorial purposes.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Seein a trophy from the perspective of a war, it is usually weapon of the emperor of the defeated empire or the weapon of the leader of a particular
        enemy's army. It is usually kept for memories and historical purposes.
            In sports, a trophy can be a decorated valuable metal cup or any form of specially made item presented to a person or to a team to show their victory after 
            winning a competition</p>
            <p style="font-size:large;">
                Generally, we can say that a trophy is a mark of victory stored for memorial purposes.
                </p><br>
                <h3>THE HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF TROPHY</h3>
                <img src="history of trophy.jpeg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="An Acient trophy"
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                The word <i>'Trophy'</i>, originates from the greek word <i>'Tropaion'</i> which means to rout. Trophy has been in existence since the history of man, hence 
                the history of trophy can be traced to the history of human race . Without international recognition, trophy has existed in different localities and in different forms
                in the World
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                In ancient wars, Human parts were used as trophies where the enemy's body parts are cut and presented as  a trophy.Also in ancient sports, winners are sometimes
                presented with olive oil and laurel wreath before silver cups were used as trophies .</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                    Progressively, Chalices became a trophy option for sports events in the late 15's and it has been evolving till today. 
                </p><br>
                <h3>THE EVOLUTION OF TROPHIES</h3>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                With the discovery and deployment of many sports facilities, Trophies has continually been evolving ranging from the design improvement and the value. Taking reference from the history of trophy,
                you will to understand that trophies has changed a lot and many kinds of trophies has come into existence today and many ancient trophies has for long been diminished 
                due to their irrelivances in the modern days sport.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                Since technological war-fare came into practice, different ways of collecting trophies in the ancient world especially from ancient battles has been discouraged
                hence diminishing most of the ancestral trophies and also giving yeild to new ones.
                </p>
                <h3>INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR MODERN DAYS TROPHIES IN SOCCER</h3><br>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                In the modern days soccer tournaments or competitions, some communities with the introduction of several competitions has brought about support for several trophies as well
                giving the level of international recognition for football an enviable distinct from many other kinds of sports  recognized globally today.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
