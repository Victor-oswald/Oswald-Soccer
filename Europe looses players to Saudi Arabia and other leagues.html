<h1>Europea Football is Stolen</h1><br><br>
      <img src="Arabia.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Arabian Players"/>
<p>
Europe being the largest host of major soccer tournaments has been prominent for several years when speaking of soccer competitions. The collection of countries including England, Spain, Switzerland,
italy, Germany and whole lots of others has given Europe an upper hand in the race of the most watched and supported soccer competitions in the world. Several leagues Europe, Saudi Arabia and America to be precise
after what seemed like a turn around in the history of football has digged deep into the European football diverting the focus of it's fans to their favour. Since what you can call an end to a football era, various players
with which Europe can count on as it's legends extended their career to these football leagues outside Europe, hence stealing the interests of various European football fans . Could we call this a revolution in the football?, in any case Europe still host
the world's most viewed and most supported tournaments but what does the future hold?, The rate at which football players are willing to leave Europe to these rivalry countries and the rate these countries demand thses talents All
look very promising.

<p>
    An era of football where most of it's viewers have their interest on the players instead of the football league is liable to loose it's viewers when it loses it's players, same goes to the European football in regards to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo
    and lots of others. This duo captures the interest of most of their viewers hence after their depature from European football, they brought along with them the interest of most of their supporters to the various leagues where they currently play. Saudi Arabia 
    and America after successfully registering these players in their leagues became threats to the European leagues as most of their supporters now prefer to view these matches over European Matches.
