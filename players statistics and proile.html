<h1>Maradona Vs Pele(Career Profile):</h1>
<p style="font-size: xx-large;">Introduction:</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">
Every proffessional footballer struggle really hard to score in every game he or she plays, they also fight tooth and nail to ensure they win trophies
for every team they play. This is because the career ranking of every player or every team depends on their achievements and no player or team would like 
to be ranked as a common player or common team. For instance, most players after retirement are been remembered and considered as legends while most of them 
seem to be forgotten after retirement. This is simply because while they still play, some players achieve more than others in their teams. Career goals 
and trophies are very important entities of every players profile, hence every player works really hard to ensure he / she ends his career with iconic profile
so as to be considered a legend after his/her era. Same goes to every team and coaches.
