    The most common means of accurately predicting a match is by analysis. here are few ways to perform a productive match analysis. 
</p>
<em><b>Form Comparison:</b></em>
<p>
    The team's form is one of the most relevant data while performing a match analysis, this is the collection of their previous match performances and winning streak. Undoughtably, the form comparison technique is a very useful means of 
    determining the squad and management quality, hence the comparison of the both oppositions form should give you enough information to determine the more quality team which is in the best position to win the match.
</p>
<em><b>Attack Rate:</b></em>
<p>
    The attacking rate of the different teams determines the scoring chances that should be created in the match. This analytic data is obtained by reviewing some of their past matches and learning of their attacking modes, the collection of these 
    data is very essential to determine or to estimate the number of goals that will be scored in the match. It is mostly used in soccer and basket ball competitions.
</p>
<em><b>Head<sub>2</sub>Head:</b></em>
<p>
    This implies the previous matches that the two teams has engaged in. You can check thier recent head to head matches to determine their performances and use it to compute your analysis. it is adviceable to use of only their recent matches and ignore old matches.

</p>
<em><b>Squad Injury update:</b></em>
<p>
    The potency of a squad reduces while some of it's key players sustain injury. It is very necessary that before you make any predictions, you check for availability of the players of each team, if the unavailable players will not affect the play pattern of the team 
    or squad, then you can go ahead and make your predictions but if the condiction is otherwise, you might have to adjust your predictions to your best interest.
