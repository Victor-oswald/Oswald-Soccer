    <h1>Why are English players very expensive? </h1>  
    <p>
The transfer of players from one club to another has become a means of raising  funds for different clubs. While some players are valued  at a very expensive fee, others might  cost less. In order to sign a player for a club, the FIFA  requirements must be reached by both the seller and the buyers.  On the 
 players side, he will only go if  he wishes to leave,except if the player in question is already out of contract from his current club.  If he is out of contract, he becomes a free agent and will require no transfer fee to be signed.
    </p>
    <p>
Some clubs especially big clubs tags a lot of fee on their players which might surpass the actual market value of the player in question, This is mostly seen amongst European clubs and on English players to be precise.

    <h2>Reasons why English players are very Expensive. </h2>
    <p>
 You might be very eager to know why some players are valued more than others, in some cases, it's because of their various levels of experience and career achievements. Does this really apply to English Players? 
 
          
    </p>
    <p>
 You must have probably noticed that no matter the level of experience of any English player, they are still valued at a very high rate. This is because of the following: 
          
    </p>
    <li><strong>FAME:</strong></li>
    <p>
 You probably know that a popular product will sell out at a higher price than a local one even if they are of thesame   quality and value.  The buyer might have to consider the source of the of the product and will  choose to pay more to buy from a trusted source, same goes to the English players. Due to their media exposure, popularity and availability to millions of fans through media sources, they are often encountered by scouters who mght be willing to sign them. When few scouters gets interested, the raises his value. 
          
    </p>
    <li><strong>HYPE:</strong></li>
    <P>
  In this case, it is the fans who do the job. As we said we earlier, English players are always available on different media sources and are opportune to be fanned by multitude of individuals who might have found one thing or the other attractive about the player. It could be his conduct, his stamina, skills or any other quality possessed by the player. The  club takes it as an advantage to value the player in irrespective of his actual worth,they market his influence perhaps. This might result in flop because he might not perform up to the expectations of people. 
          
    </P>
    <li><strong>INTERNATIONAL RELEVANCE: </strong></li>
    <p>
 Different clubs holds English players as assets in their clubs due to their national value. If you are conversant with football histories, you probably have seen or heard of some legacies created by some of the English players of the past, it might interest you to know that those legacies still uphold the image and value of the nation in respect to football. Every English player is expected to perform accordingly. Indirectly,  most clubs hoard English players just to gain from their national fame and value,  while some clubs sells players in respect of the nation's relevance disregarding the player's actual market worth and value. 
 <li><strong>INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT: </strong></li>
 <p>
 The dream of every footballer is to  earn the support of his nation. Well,this is the secret to the success of several English players. They are globally, hence their flaws  are seen by few while their peak  performances are seen by many. Even when they fail to perform, the cheer from the fans gears them up to work hard and come back stronger in the subsequent appearances. In order to retain this honour, they walk the extra mile with dedication and hope.  This in turn,returns nothing but success. When a player's performances turns extraordinary, his value will definitely rise to the peak. This simply means that most English players have the fans  to thank for thier market worth.
