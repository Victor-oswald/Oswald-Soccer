    <h1>Why are English players very expensive? </h1>  
    <p>
The transfer of players from one club to another has become a means of raising  funds for different clubs. While some players are valued  at a very expensive fee, others might  cost less. In order to sign a player for a club, the FIFA  requirements must be reached by both the seller and the buyers.  On the 
 players side, he will only go if  he wishes to leave,except if the player in question is already out of contract from his current club.  If he is out of contract, he becomes a free agent and will require no transfer fee to be signed.

    <p>
Some clubs especially big clubs tags a lot of fee on their players which might surpass the actual market value of the player in question, This is mostly seen amongst European clubs and on English players to be precise.
